# Configuration files!

Editor based mainly. I'm testing some tweaks after migrating from vimrc to lua.
For the time being I'm playing around changing the tatami colorscheme and
setting up some leaderkey + action combos for fuzzy find / fuzzy snake jump

Font is go monospace (2016)

I added support for tree with lots of custom tweaks and icons for better usability.
So far looks smooth on toggle, close, icon-wise and width.
I also sleeked alacritty and started using tmux with bindings.
Experience is nice so far and could get into the zone while switching between editor
tab and console/execution tab

TODOs
- When scrolling on tmux and swapping tabs not only it does not work with the assigned
binding but it also loses the last scrolled state. I should fix this
- I want to create a installer to use on my go-to laptop. It does not have my config and
I want to unify that
- There is a weird looking orange square icon on the fiels when applying modifications.
I think they are supposed to be the (M)odified, (U)ptaded and (D)eleted states so i should
take a good look into that, currently is not working
- Colorscheme wise, it would be nice to zen/even out the palette for the light screen mode.
Right know after adding the lua status line it feels bloated at times
